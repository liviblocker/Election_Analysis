## Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
For this election audit we were asked to complete the following tasks for a recent local congressional election in Colorado.

  1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
  2. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
  3. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Results:
The analysis of the election show that:
  
  * The total number of votes cast in the congressional election was 369,711.
  
  * The voter turnout for each county is as follows:
  
    * Jefferson County: 10.5% (38,855 votes)
    * Denver County: 82.8% (306,055 votes)
    * Arapahoe County: 6.7% (24,801 votes)
 
  * The Denver County had the highest turnout with 82.8% voter turnout (a total of 306,055 ballots cast).
  
  * The total number of votes cast for each candidate are as follows:
  
    * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
    
  * The winner of the election is Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the vote (a total of 272,892 votes).
  
  ## Election-Audit Summary
  The above analysis was completed by writing a code to output the winner of the congressional election in Colorado and the county with the highest turnout. The script also outputs a full candidate and county list and the number of votes associated with each. With some modifications this script can be utilized to output those same results in any given election, including national elections or smaller city races. The same logic applies, though the variable names may need to be updated for clarity. As you can see in the code below, I've associated different variable names to different columns in the election data that was provided:
  
  By adding candidates or counties, or the number of ballots more generally, then with the click of a button a new analysis can be run.
  
  Additionally, the same code can be adapted for a number of uses. If we received any demographic information from the ballots, then the script can be adapted to determine the most popular candidate among women or African American voters, for example. This script, therefore, is not only helpful for determining election results, but can also be helpful in better understanding the constituency of various candidates that could determine policy considerations that impact specific demographic groups. These data would also be helpful for re-election purposes: to better understand what demographics were not reached by a particular candidate.
  
  With more robust voter demographic data we could also better determine what demographic populations voted in which counties. The racial demographics of voters by county - when compared to the general racial demographics of the county - could also be used to determine if there is poor turnout by a particular racial demographic group. This can, in turn, be used to determine if there are particular effects of voter suppression laws or other accessiblity issues to voting on a hyperlocal level.
  
  This is all to say, this script and my ability to adapt the code for further analysis could be helpful beyond this election. If given the opportunity to continue working with the election commission further, I can provide analysis that can be used in a wide variety of ways.
